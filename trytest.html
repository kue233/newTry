                        My name is Topu Saha and I am a undergraduate student at New Jersey City University studying computer science. As a high schooler, I was interested in solving problems and backend development. After a five minute overview of a computer science topic I would code solutions to problems even if they were small.  This led me to Increase my fundamental knowledge with coding challenges and puzzles. After some time, I was able to develop a sort of gaming mindset with programming. To me, programming is solving a problem with the tools in my arsenal. The weapons in my arsenal being the languages, and knowledge I have mastery in. With this research project, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to overlap my skills in programming and knowledge in statistics to tackle a problem with data science and machine learning.
